Medicine is something which we all purchase at some point of time. At times, we consume half of that strip and remaining half stays there in our drawer till its expiry. 
These expired medicines are leading to distrous situations in society. Many of the people, wild life animals are getting affected. 

### Do you know how expired medicines are usually dealt with?
We throw it in dustbin and ultimately these medicines are  dumped into landfills. The toxic chemicals of medicines gets consumed by soil. It toxicates the ground water and near by areas. 
As per studies, Vultures and many other wild life animals dies after consuming the waste that's in landfills.

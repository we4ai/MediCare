Medicine is something which we all purchase at some point of time. At times, we consume half of that strip and remaining half stays there in our drawer till its expiry. 
These expired medicines are leading to distrous situations in society. Many of the people, wild life animals are getting affected. 

### Do you know how expired medicines are usually dealt with?
We throw it in dustbin and ultimately these medicines are  dumped into landfills. The toxic chemicals of medicines gets consumed by soil. It toxicates the ground water and near by areas. 
As per studies, Vultures and many other wild life animals dies after consuming the waste that's in landfills. 


## Our Solution: MediCare
We have coded a mobile application that gives access to public for checking the medicines stock that they have. The USP of application is that it provides a way to transfer the medicines from one user to other. 
This helps to reduce the expired medicines. 

## Need for this platform
We are basically dealing with lot of wastage of medicines and associated products because of various reasons. some are medicines getting expired and ultimately creating waste, either on individual level or at a large scale in hospital, buying excess medicines than required and wasting lot of tablets, or by simply hoard medicine which is being accumulated by patients from Govt healthcare. Ultimately medicines goes to landfill, creating issues not only hazardous for humans but for the wildlife as well. Vultures in India are on verge of extinction because of misuse of diclofenac on cattle, rise of Drug Resistant Microorganisms, creating new infectious diseases, Medicinal waste is a vicious cycle of environment degradation and poor health. Instead we can create a solution which will not only help the needy, it is going to remove the ill effects and a very big challenge to a healthy environment, and ultimately creating earth a better place for Humans, and the life on earth. In future, this solution can be enhanced to accelerate the cooperation and create a positive impact such as recycling of the chemical waste we produce by creating better avenues for their safe disposal.
